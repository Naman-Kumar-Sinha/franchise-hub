## Methodology

### Development Approach

The project follows a **hybrid development methodology** combining agile principles with modern full-stack development practices:

**Frontend Development:**
- **Component-Driven Architecture**: Utilizes Angular 17+ standalone components with lazy loading for optimal performance
- **Reactive Programming**: Implements RxJS observables for state management and asynchronous operations
- **Material Design System**: Employs Angular Material 17+ for consistent, accessible UI components
- **Form-Driven Validation**: Uses reactive forms with comprehensive client-side validation

**Backend Development:**
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Organizes code around business domains (authentication, franchises, applications, payments)
- **RESTful API Design**: Implements OpenAPI 3.0 specification with comprehensive endpoint documentation
- **Security-First Approach**: Integrates Spring Security with JWT authentication and role-based access control
- **Database Abstraction**: Uses Spring Data JPA with profile-based database switching (SQLite for development, MySQL for production)

**Technology Choices:**

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Frontend Framework | Angular 17+ | Type safety, enterprise-grade tooling, Material Design integration |
| Backend Framework | Spring Boot 3.2.1 | Mature ecosystem, security features, Java 21 LTS support |
| Database | SQLite/MySQL | Development flexibility with production scalability |
| Authentication | JWT | Stateless, scalable, cross-platform compatibility |
| API Documentation | OpenAPI 3.0 | Industry standard, interactive testing, code generation |
| State Management | RxJS + Services | Reactive patterns, memory efficiency, real-time updates |

### Implementation Strategy

**Hybrid Authentication System:**
- Demo accounts (`business@demo.com`, `partner@demo.com`) use MockDataService with localStorage persistence
- Real accounts integrate with Spring Boot API and database persistence
- Environment-based feature flags control authentication strategy

**Data Management:**
- **Development**: SQLite database for rapid prototyping and testing
- **Production**: MySQL with connection pooling and performance optimization
- **Demo Mode**: localStorage-based persistence for demonstration purposes
